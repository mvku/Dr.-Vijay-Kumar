       	<p align="left">
	<p style='text-align: justify;'>We report calorimetric and X-ray measurements in the R1, R2, and R5 rotator phases of a long chain alkane
(n-tetracosane) in bulk and confined to porous matrices (PTFE and Anopore) of two different length scales. Probing the
order within and normal to the layers, in the Anopore case having a mesoscopic length scale (200 nm), drastic weakening
of the R2-R1 and R1-R5 transitions is seen. The effect on the latter is to such an extent that it results in the first
observation of a confinement-driven second order transition in these systems. A significant reduction of the temperature
range of the R1 phase is also seen in the Anopore case, a feature argued to cause the change in the order of the transition.
Comparisons are also made on the recent prediction of such a point in a Landau model. These findings, while paving a
new means of realizing a tricritical point, will lead to better understanding of finite size effects in alkanes.

transitions</h3>
        <p align="left"> 
	<p style='text-align: justify;'>Calorimetric measurements on composites of a long chain n-alkane, tetracosane, doped with
nanosilica aerosil particles decorated with a corona of hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature are described.
The weakly perturbing random field created by the addition of the aerosil particles has the general
effect of weakening all the transitions to, and between, the three different rotator phases that the pure
alkane exhibits. One of highlights of the studies is that the strong first order transitions of the pure
alkane, viz., from the isotropic liquid to hexagonal rotator phase (Iso–R2), and tilted monoclinic
rotator phase to the crystalline phase (R5–Cr), are accompanied by a much weaker supplementary
peak at lower temperatures. In analogy with observations made in aerosil composites of liquid
crystalline systems, and additionally with information from preliminary Xray diffraction
measurements on the currently studied materials, it is reasoned that the subsidiary peaks are nothing
but the transformations between the same phases as the corresponding main peaks due to the bulk of
the material, but occurring in the vicinity of the surface of the aerosil particles. The nature of the
corona of the aerosil particles also seems to play an important role. For the bulk transitions, the
reduction in the transition enthalpy is higher for the composites with the hydrophilic particles, than
those with hydrophobic particles; the opposite is true for the surface transitions. The data also suggest
that the lowering of the transition temperature of the surface transition with respect to its bulk
counterpart is more for the hydrophobic composites than the hydrophilic ones. We provide an
explanation for these features based on the surface interactions between the particles and tetracosane
molecules, and also the strength of the gel network.

Polar Liquid Lrystals Doped with Carbon Nanotubes</h3>
		<p align="left">
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>We performed dielectric and conductivity measurements on a
composite of carbon nanotubes and a liquid crystal possessing dual frequency switching
characteristics. The conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude with respect to that
for the host liquid crystal, and achieves negligible temperature dependence. The frequency
dependence of the ac conductivity is explained by the extended pair approximation model,
although the exponent is slightly higher than generally seen. We demonstrate that the current
through the sample can be field-driven between the two anisotropic values (170:1) by simply
changing the frequency of the applied voltage, and exhibiting at least a millisecond response.
The chapter also presents a comparison in the dielectric and conductivity behaviour when the
polarity of the host LC is substantially changed.

Unusual Phase Sequence with Induction of a Phase in
an n-Alkane – Liquid Crystal Binary System</h3>
        <p align="left">
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>we demonstrate two important features that arise out of introducing a
liquid crystalline (LC) compound into the rotator phase matrix, and the consequent
competition between the anisometric segments of the LC moieties, and the aliphatic units.
First, we show that the change in the structural character of the mixed medium depends on
which of the entities forms the minority concentration: in case of this being the alkane, the
two components of the binary system get nanophase segregated, whereas if the LC molecules
are in small concentration then the layered structure merely gets roughened without any
segregation. The second and more significant result of the calorimetric and Xray
experiments, at low LC concentrations, is the induction of a rotator phase that leads to
unusual phase sequence, not reported hitherto. Possible scenarios for the molecular
arrangement are discussed. A Landau model is also presented that explains some of the
observed features.

        <p align="left">
	<p style='text-align: justify;'>We investigated calorimetric and dielectric investigations on a pure nematic
liquid crystal (LC) and its composites comprising Gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Calorimetric
measurements show that the inclusion of GNP has a strong influence on the isotropic ̶
nematic transition temperature as well its first order character in terms of the transition
entropy. The absolute value of conductivity increases by two-three orders of magnitude with
respect to that for the host liquid crystal and its concentration dependence is demonstrated to
be described by the percolation scaling law generally observed in composites of metal
particles and polymers. The frequency dependence of the ac conductivity exhibits a critical
frequency that is concentration-dependent, but the exponents obtained defy Jonscher’s
Universal Response principle. A surprising feature is the observation of a substantial
increase in permittivity and their anisotropy values with faster director relaxation in the
presence GNP. We provide an explanation for this antagonistic behaviour in terms of the
alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the vicinity of GNP, and the importance of the
weak polarity of the liquid crystal used. The second part of the Chapter looks at the influence
of embedding the LC-GNP composite in a restricted geometry created by aerosil particles.
The inclusion of aerosil particles creating a gel network, albeit being non-conducting,
surprisingly enhances the already high conductivity of the LC-GNP material. The nature of
the aerosil corona (hydrophobic/hydrophilic) also controls the behavior. We argue that these
features are caused by the amelioration of the percolation network of GNPs through the
primary gel network of the hydrogen bonding aerosil particles. The concept can be
generalized for a variety of systems wherein metal nanoparticles are imbibed in an insulating
matrix.
